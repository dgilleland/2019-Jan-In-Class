-- Take the following queries and turn them into stored procedures.

-- 1.   Selects the studentID's, CourseID and mark where the Mark is between 70 and 80
SELECT  StudentID, CourseId, Mark
FROM    Registration
WHERE   Mark BETWEEN 70 AND 80 -- BETWEEN is inclusive
--      Place this in a stored procedure that has two parameters,
--      one for the upper value and one for the lower value.
--      Call the stored procedure ListStudentMarksByRange


/* ----------------------------------------------------- */

-- 2.   Selects the Staff full names and the Course ID's they teach.
SELECT  DISTINCT -- The DISTINCT keyword will remove duplate rows from the results
        FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS 'Staff Full Name',
        CourseId
FROM    Staff S
    INNER JOIN Registration R
        ON S.StaffID = R.StaffID
ORDER BY 'Staff Full Name', CourseId
--      Place this in a stored procedure called CourseInstructors.


/* ----------------------------------------------------- */

-- 3.   Selects the students first and last names who have last names starting with S.
SELECT  FirstName, LastName
FROM    Student
WHERE   LastName LIKE 'S%'
--      Place this in a stored procedure called FindStudentByLastName.
--      The parameter should be called @PartialName.
--      Do NOT assume that the '%' is part of the value in the parameter variable;
--      Your solution should concatenate the @PartialName with the wildcard.


/* ----------------------------------------------------- */

-- 4.   Selects the CourseID's and Coursenames where the CourseName contains the word 'programming'.
SELECT  CourseId, CourseName
FROM    Course
WHERE   CourseName LIKE '%programming%'
--      Place this in a stored procedure called FindCourse.
--      The parameter should be called @PartialName.
--      Do NOT assume that the '%' is part of the value in the parameter variable.


/* ----------------------------------------------------- */

-- 5.   Selects the Payment Type Description(s) that have the highest number of Payments made.
SELECT PaymentTypeDescription
FROM   Payment 
    INNER JOIN PaymentType 
        ON Payment.PaymentTypeID = PaymentType.PaymentTypeID
GROUP BY PaymentType.PaymentTypeID, PaymentTypeDescription 
HAVING COUNT(PaymentType.PaymentTypeID) >= ALL (SELECT COUNT(PaymentTypeID)
                                                FROM Payment 
                                                GROUP BY PaymentTypeID)
--      Place this in a stored procedure called MostFrequentPaymentTypes.
