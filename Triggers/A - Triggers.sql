--4. Our school DBA has suddenly disabled some Foreign Key constraints to deal with performance issues! Create a trigger on the Registration table to ensure that only valid CourseIDs, StudentIDs and StaffIDs are used for grade records. (You can use sp_help tablename to find the name of the foreign key constraints you need to disable to test your trigger.) Have the trigger raise an error for each foreign key that is not valid. If you have trouble with this question create the trigger so it just checks for a valid student ID.
