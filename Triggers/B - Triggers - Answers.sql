-- A. Create a trigger to ensure that an instructor does not teach more than 3 courses in a given semester.

-- B. Create a trigger to ensure that students cannot be added to a course if the course is already full.

-- C. Create a trigger that will add students to a wait list if the course is already full. You should design the WaitList table to accommodate the changes needed for adding a student to the course once space is freed up for the course. Students should be added on a first-come-first-served basis (i.e. - include a timestamp in your WaitList table)

-- D. Create a trigger that will add students to a course whenever another student withdraws from that course. Pull your students from the WaitList table on a first-come-first-served basis.
